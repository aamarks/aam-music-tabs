The Maine - Birthday in Los Angeles 

Pretty much for the cd version, but specifically as in this studio version

The strumming usually skips the high e-string for the first half of each measure,
and then emphasizes either the second string or a new note in the e-string
on the second half of the measure.

...L.A. pick up the phone, I need to talk to you
     G                    Am           Am               C
Stop sleeping with my new friends, and all the old ones too
  G              Am     Am                        C
Remember when we met, I thought you thought I was boring
    G                Am          Am                F
You called me on the phone, to arrange my birthday party

[verse 2]
C   G                    Am         Am             C
You showed me around the house, You took me by the wrist
    G                     Am        Am       C
You introduced me to your pals, the scientologists
   G            Am              Am              C
We cut the cake and sang, And I tried to fake a smile
      G                     Am              Am              F
And I drank, and drank, and drank, 'cause I felt so out of style

         G                 C     C    F
But this ain't my birthday party
         G              C     C
No, it's just a fashion show

Dm           G                  Am Am/G D7/F#  Fm
Yeah this is something, it just is n’t  me
G#dim     C*        Em*         F*   F*

[verse 3]
C      G            Am      Am           C  
Well I do miss Hollywood, enjoy the hazy city
    G                   Am        Am                 F
I’m sure you’re feeling good, but soon enough you’ll miss me

      G                 C      C
But I ain’t got so much money,
F     G             C      C
and nobody knows my name

Dm          G                Am   Am/G D7/F#  Fm
But here is something I just have to   say
G#dim      C
Fuck you L.A.
