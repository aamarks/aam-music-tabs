There Is An Everlasting Song
Belle and Sebastian

This by request on UG and only samples were available online, so especially the ending 
may have some variation or Outro as I've never heard the complete song.
The first note of the chord is plucked then the rest strummed. There's a walk down the 5th string
changing from C to Am (c-b-a).

Verse 1
C           C           F          C
There is an everlasting song on my lips
C        C          F                   C
I got up early so I don't let that song slip
Am         Am               D
And mighty is the voice I'm singing with
   D                 F
It beats out all the dread
F                   F         F
Defeats the eyes of darkness

Verse 2
C           C           F             C
There is an everlasting promise to be made
C         C                F              C
My ink is wet, there is no paper could contain
Am           Am             D
The depth of feeling that I pledge to you
D             F    F             F   F
Solemn as the sea, solemn as the sea

Verse 3
C           C           F                C
There is an everlasting morning near the sun
C          C                 F                C
It burns a hole in my heart, makes me want to run
Am          Am             D                D
And I would run all day if they give me the choice
            F      F           F
I hear your voice, I hear your voice
F           (C-interlude)
I hear your voice

Verse 4
C           C           F               C
There is an everlasting gladness of the heart
C            C               F             C
The stranger looks at me and loves me as I am
Am        Am             D              D
One day I stand upon the river's scared shore
F    F             F   F
And feel the sun, I feel the sun

Verse 5
C           C           F            C
There is an everlasting sadness all around
C           C                   F               C
It's bigger than the news, from this you cannot run
Am        Am          D             D
A woman's magazine, a column in the mail
               F    F              F    F
Can't help you now, can't help you now

Verse 6
C          C                  F               C
I love the summer birds, they sing no word of lie
C          C                     F                 C
The air is cruel, the frost will cast them as they fly
Am           Am        D                 D
But glorious the sun returns to wake the year
             F     F            F
They show no fear, they show no fear
F            C
They show no fear
