Bob Dylan - To Fall In Love With You 
            https://youtu.be/Sr10xoxUj1w

Thanks to Pete Sugarman's youtube videos for publicising this apparently lost song of that never made it past the rough draft stage. He has a few other old recordings of Dylan posted as well. His channel was removed. Some of it is back either by him or someone reposting some of videos.

Hearts Of Fire recording session, Townhouse Studio, London, England, 27 & 28 August 1986, produced by Beau Hill.
backed by Eric Clapton (guitar), Ron Wood & Kip Winger (bass), Beau Hill (keyboards) and Henry Spinetti (drums).

This is in the key of B. Capo 4 makes for easier chords.
If you tune your guitar down a half step you can play without a capo using another easy set of chords, 
C F G Am. (Just hit the transpose up button +5 on UG to change the chords here). 

Except for the G D Em C sequence, the D-chords are just brief transitions to the next chord. 
Much simpler to learn if you think of it as C C Em C x2, G D Em C x2, Em G G. Strum pattern shown is 
just a rough guide. Play the D's for that last u-d-u. You can already be leaving D on the last up.

Strumming: 
           1+2+3+4+

Many of the words are hard to make out. He wasn't finished figuring them out so don't worry 
too much about it. Go with what seems right to you — make it better!   Tabbed by --Art

[Verse 1]
  D         C        D      C
A tear goes down, my day is real 
         D      Em     D      C
Put your drying eye, upon the same 
     D       C         D       C
Each needs a road, for me from you 
     D   Em         D     C
What paradise? What can I do? 

             G                  D
That die for my, and the day is dark 
          Em                 C
I can’t believe, for him to touch 
             G                D
What I could find, oh time is right 
             Em               C
If I fell in love, to fall in love 
   D       Em    D    G      G
To fall in love, with you. 

[Verse 2]
    D      C         D       C
The day is dark, our time is right 
    D      Em          D      C
Day in the night, deep in the night 
        D      C             D    C
I can’t yet be back, I heard my-a surprise 
         D       Em              D       C
I see it in your lips, I knew it in your eyes 

                 G                   D
Well I feel your love, and I feel no shame 
                     Em                 C
I can’t unleash your heart, I call your name 
               G              D
What you’re to me, what can I do? 
           Em               C
To fall in love, to fall in love, 
   D       Em    D    G      G
To fall in love, with you. 

[Verse 3]
   D    C        D      C
It just rolls, upon the sand 
     D        Em       D      C
Ever this for now, I’m made a man 
    D        C         D     C
Can make you see, what I can find 
          D     Em             D     C
I know it in my days, ah in my daily mind 

             G               D
Oh will ages roll, will ages fly? 
            Em                 C
I hear your name, where angels lie. 
          G                      D
What do I know? For to come it’s true. 
           Em               C
To fall in love, to fall in love, 
   D       Em    D    G      G
To fall in love, with you. 

[Verse 4]
    D       C            D    C
How can the doors, trust on a nail? 
          D     Em              D     C
How can I be surprised, of most every day? 
       D       C             D      C
In the distant road, I can’t be the same
  D       Em      D       C
I feel no love, I feel no shame 

                    G                D
I can not watch the bay, out on my unknown 
                 Em                   C
we've a destined man, I can attest it all 
                      G                   D
I didn’t know I could find, where I could go 
           Em               C
To fall in love, to fall in love, 
   D       Em    D    G      G
To fall in love, with you.
