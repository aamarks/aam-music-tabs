Strum on prechorus is just once on the first beat.
He sometimes throws in a hammer on, like with the middle finger on 3rd beat of the Am.
E7 is an option, but I think it's E. He uses C/G (which I use by default playing C) which sounds better than hitting an open or muted low E string when jamming all the strings like he does.

It sounds/looks like the banjo is playing this at the end of each of the two lines in the pre-chorus (I've shown just the first 3 strings transcribed to guitar).

[Verse 1]
C               E                  Am               F
Honey you are a rock and I am your land and we will grow.
C              E                           Am       F
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand.    Oh
C               E                   Am                 F
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?
C           E                          Am            F
And ran to another world with lives to save.         Oh

    a-hoh...

They flew so high.

[Chorus]
C               E                  Am            F
Then I looked into your eyes never understanding why.
C               E                     Am               F
You would never run with me while the world is turning upside down
C                  E                     Am                        F
And all around and we are watching those birds in the sky from the mountainside and
C        E      Am      F
you,   a-hoh  o-hoh

C              E                           Am        F
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand.     Oh
C               E                   Am                 F
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?

And ran to another world with lives to save.       Oh
