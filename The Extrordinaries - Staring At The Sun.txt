Staring at the Sun - The Extraordinaires

C#m  446654
E    022100
F#m  244222
G#   466544
D    557775
C#m6/A# x12120
A    577655 (barred in bridge, open elsewhere)

He occasionally throws in a pinky on E -> E6 022120 and maybe A -> A7 x02223 when playing the chorus.

Wasn't sure about the chord before the last A in the verses. It only took me 3 years, coming back to it and finally hearing the A# in the released version and sort of making up a chord that fit, C#m6/A# ! It might just be an A in the last verse. I have an F in the bridge that sounds a little odd if you don't whistle the tune, but it sounds right when playing with the video.

[Intro] 
(Uses verse 1 chords. Pull the pinky to get the 7ths mid measure)
C#m  C#m (2 bars. Only in video version. C#m7 thrown in)
(Whistling begins)
C#m  E  A  G# G#7
F#m  E  C#m6/A#  A   (uses verse 1 chords)

[Verse 1]
C#m
We were never well-acquainted
E
And everyone you knew was a state behind you
A                                 G# G#7
Left to wonder where you went and why
           F#m          E
But did it come as a surprise
         C#m6/A#                        A
That our voices carried further in your mind
                           C#m
than you would ever recognize

[Verse 2]
C#m
We were on a first name basis,
E
you were never good with names or faces
A                                     G# G#7
I hate to think we never crossed your mind
          F#m          E
But is it any question why?
       C#m6/A#        A
In the end I couldn't stand the thought of you

[Chorus]
E                             A
Laying in bed, staring at the Sun   (x4)

[Verse 3]
C#m
We followed you across the nation,
E
just another page in the compilation
A                            G#
But I was never there to disagree
          F#m       E            A                 G# G#7
But is it any mystery that you'd still be haunting me?
         F#m                           E
And am I better now to know your history?
           C#m6/A#                        A
Or could I ever been the one to hold your hand
                            (E)
And whisper to you while you were

[Chorus]
E                             A
Laying in bed, staring at the Sun   (x4)

Laying in bed, staring at the Sun   (x4)
