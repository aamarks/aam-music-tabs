On A Sunday from Lost & Found by Corey Crowder
 
released 04 December 2009
listen: http://coreycrowder.bandcamp.com/track/on-a-sunday
 
   The first section sounds like a verse but I've labeled it a chorus since it repeats,
   and the chorus-sounding section changes lyrics so it's labeled verse.
 
   There is some sort of transition to G in "wave to the sky" (G/C) that I can't quite figure out,
   but it may just be an early switch to G on the last strum or 2 of the C-measure.
 
   First G in the GFGC riff at the end of "thankful I'm alive"
   is barred [355433] and slid down to F [133211]
   and the barred G is probably used in the verses as well.

[Chorus]
C                 F               C
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                         G/C G
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                    G            F
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
G F G C  x2
G F G

[Verse 1]
    F                  G
The neighbors hear our conversations 
    F                   G                 Am
But they can't hear the love we're making now 
  F                  G
I kissed your cheek as you were waking 
  F               G                 Am     G
I told you that I loved you and you smiled 

[Chorus]
C                 F           C
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                             G
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                    G            F
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
G F G C  x2
G F G

[Verse 1]
    F                  G
Forget about the smoke we're clearing 
    F                G                 Am
Just think of me and know that you are needed 
  F                  G
Slowly move, it's me I'm cheating 
  F               G                 Am     G
An open mind is what I'm seeking now 

[Chorus]
C                 F               C
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                             G
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                      G          F
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
C              G              F
Maybe we'll be thankful we're alive 
G F G C
