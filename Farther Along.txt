[Verse 1]
G                        C           G     
Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
G                     D                  
Why it should be thus all the day long,
G                      C           G     
While there are others living about us,
G               C             G       
Never molested, though in the wrong.

[Chorus]
G                   C                  
Farther along we'll know all about it,
                                    
Farther along we'll understand why;
                                           
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
                                   
We'll understand it all by and by.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
When death has come and taken our loved ones,
                                        
It leaves our home so lonely and drear,
                                     
Then do we wonder why others prosper
                                  
Living so wicked year after year.

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it,
                                    
Farther along we'll understand why;
                                           
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
                                   
We'll understand it all by and by.

[Outro]




2. Farther Along - Marideth Sisco (cover)

From the soundtrack to Winter's Bone, played into the credits.

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
                                        
Why it should be thus all the day long,
                                        
While there are others living about us,
                                     
Never molested, though in the wrong.

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it,
                                    
Farther along we'll understand why.
                                          
Cheer up my sister, live in the sunshine,
                                       
Cuz we'll understand it all by and by.

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder, why must I suffer
                                       
Out in the rain, the cold and the snow
                                       
When there are many, living in comfort
                                  
Giving no heed to all that I know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Often when death has taken our loved one,
                                      
Leaving our home so lonely and drear,
                                       
Then do we wonder, why others prosper,
                                   
Living so wicked, year after year.

[Chorus]
We'll understand it all by and by.




3. Farther Along - Mississippi John Hurt (original?)





Faithful til death, said our loving Master
A few more days to labor and wait,
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
As we sweet through the beautiful gate.

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

When we see Jesus, coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the sky,
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,
We'll understand it all by and by.

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.
