Key change in the middle of the song. I haven't analyzed a key change before. This one happens in the verse that usually goes I - V - I. Instead of going back to I, it shifts the key up a half step, not to the new I chord, but shifting up from the current V (A#) to the new V chord (B).

Key of Dâ™¯m

D#m [x68876]
A#  [688766]
B   [799877] (same bar chords up 1 fret after the key change)

F#  [x 9 11 11 11 9]
C#  [9 11 11 10 9 9]
F   [x 8 10 10 10 8]
E   [x79997]
