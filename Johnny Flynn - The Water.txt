[Intro]
(walk the last G)
C G C F C G
Em F F

[Verse 1]
C          G         F     F   
All that I have is a river
    Am       Am        E     E                        
The river is always my home
      C       F             
Lord, take me away
      C           F      
For I just cannot stay
        C          G           Am     
Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

[Chorus]
                                          
The water sustains me without even trying
                                   
The water can't drown me, I'm done
              
With my dying

[Verse 2]
                                  
Please help me build a small boat
                             
One that'll ride on the flow
                          
Where the river runs deep
                          
And the larger fish creep
                                 
I'm glad of what keeps me afloat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
                            
Now deeper the water I sail
                              
And faster the current I'm in
                                 
That each night brings the stars
                         
And the song in my heart
                                    
Is a tune for the journeyman's tale

[Chorus]


[Bridge]
                                    
Now the land that I knew is a dream
                                         
And the line on the distance grows faint
                    
So wide is my river
                     
The horizon a sliver
                                
The artist has run out of paint

[Verse 4]
                                        
Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
                                     
And the big yellow sun leads me home
                   
I'm everywhere now
                 
The way is a vow
                                     
To the wind of each breath by and by

[Chorus]


[Outro]
