(There are alternate names for those chord shapes. I'm no expert and can't say which are proper for the key.)
I'm using ellipses after the basic chord when there is a quick series of note changes. 
Hard to tell sometimes when he's playing a note with the pinky or just using it to mute.

    [Intro] 
    8 bars G6-Gdim G6-Gdim ... G6-Gdim-G6-Gdim [stop]
    
    [Verses]
                G6
    When you're up
        Gdim G6
    You come down
         Gdim G6   Gdim G6      E7
    Then you hide, in a cloud I wonder 
         C...   Cm7...  G6     D6...
    What I, can do, for you
    
    
    You get big
    You get small
    There are nights that I don't see you at all Oh what's your name
    Must be something, I can do for you
    
    
    [Corus]
         G6
    Blue moon 
                          E7
    When you gonna come a-round
                            C6                 D6                 G6...  
    I'm here waiting on the ground and I'll be here when you come down
    
    
    
    When you're up
    You come down
    Then you hide, from the crowd I wonder 
    What I, can do, for you
    
    
    You get big
    You get small
    There are nights I want to give you a call  Oh what's your name
    Must be something, I can do for you  
                                         Gdim-D-G6
    
    
    You come near
    You go far 
    I'll be here, if you call  Oh what a shame, 
    Must be something, I can do for you
    
    
    [Repeat Corus above, then]
    Gdim    D    
    I wanna hold you
    
         G6 [...as above]
    Blue moon 
    How'd you make it on your own
    You don't need to be a-lone
    Just let me know when you come down
    
         G
    Blue moon
                        B7
    I can't take it any more
                          Em
    Are you hollow at the core
                             B7
    Let your worries hit the floor
         G
    Blue moon
                         B7
    Take it easy take it slow
                             Em
    We don't have nowhere to go
                            C6            D6    G6
    You just have to let me know when you come around
    
    
    [Repeat those chords G... out and end with the G6-Gdim switches ending with G6=7777]
