Key of Bb --> Capo 3: G
It's a bit confusing to notate a song relative to a capo and then have parts, like the intro here, played with bar chords. The first bar chord is a Cm, but since we need to keep the notation of the capo it's Am (and the numbers are relative to the capo). The capo is used to make the quick pulls used throughout the song possible.

Intro chords:
A     [x x 7 9 10 9]
Emaj7 [x79897]
G     [xx5787] or? Gmaj7 [xx5777]
Dmaj7 [x57675]
F     [xx3565] or? Fmaj7 [xx3555]
Cmaj7 [x.5453]

Chords:
D  [xx0232] or sometimes he plays D*
G  [320003][3x0003] 
C/G [3x2013]
C  [x32010] [x32013]
D* [554030] (open C slid up 2)
Em [022000]
B7 [x21202]

G(C/G) combo:
G played with pinky and 3rd finger slightly muting 5th string so that hammering 5th lowers string and sounds. Then first two fingers make the C/G (C with G in the base) pulling off on each strum.
     G        C/G
   d    u  u  d  d
e--3----3--3--3--3---
B--0----0--0--1p-1p--
G--0----0--0--0--0---
D--0----0--0--2p-2p--
A--.-h2-2--.--x--x---
E--3----3--3--3--3---
The Gs at the ends of lines are played like that.
