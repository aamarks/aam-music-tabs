Capo 2


[Intro]
C C C C  x2


[Verse 1]
C               E                  Am               F
Honey you are a rock and I am your land and we will grow.
C              E                           Am       F
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand.    Oh
C               E                   Am                 F
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?
C           E                          Am            F
And ran to another world with lives to save.         Oh
C     E     Am     F
    a-hoh...


[Pre Chorus]
C             E              Am
They were the ones who could fly.
C    E       Am        
They flew so high.


[Chorus]
C               E                  Am            F
Then I looked into your eyes never understanding why.
C               E                     Am               F
You would never run with me while the world is turning upside down
C                  E                     Am                        F
And all around and we are watching those birds in the sky from the mountainside and
C        E      Am      F
you,   a-hoh  o-hoh

C              E                           Am        F
Before the sun dries us up and turns us to sand.     Oh 
C               E                   Am                 F
Do you remember when the ocean went mad and we were to blame?
C           E                          Am          F
And ran to another world with lives to save.       Oh 
C     E     Am     F
    a-hoh...

They were the ones who could fly.
C    E       Am        C    
They flew so high.
