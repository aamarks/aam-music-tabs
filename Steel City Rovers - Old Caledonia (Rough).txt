Capo 2

[Intro]
C G Am Am7/g F F G G
C G Am Am7/g F G C

[Verse 1]
         C         G           Am       (Am7/G)
Sweetest Girl, I'm so proud to know you.
         F                   G
Heart of fire and manners so mild.
    C    G          Am      (Am7/G)
I desire tonight to show you
           F            G         C
'Round the town where I grew as a child.

[Chorus]
         F                           C
So let's stroll down through Old Caledonia.
          F               G
Climb the hill of Old Aberdeen.
       F                     C     G   Am
By the Grand Riverside we'll share our mind.
         F              G           C
And I'll return to this night in my dreams.

[Verse 2]
Dearest Man, how grandly you escort me.
Spin me 'round and 'round Edinburgh Square.
Leave a trail of stardust behind me.
So they'll know that we two were once there.

[Chorus]

[Instrumental (chorus chords then verse chords)]

[Verse 3]
May we stay here a little while longer?
In this moment so rare and so fine.
Hand in hand we'll linger together.
Pure and pristine for all time.

[Chorus (repeat last line 3x)]

[Outro (chorus chords)]
