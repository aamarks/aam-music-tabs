Notes:
Celtic Tuning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl9q6dFOpA4
but this is not played with Celtic tuning

This is an easy version (but the chords get out of sequence compared to the actual)

Capo 8 (Cadd9 set)
G D Em D 
G C Em D
G D Em D 
G C Em D

[Verse 1]
         G          D            Em          D  
Here and now we are less than we were nearly yesterday.
G          C          Em           D
Death is a mystery to those left behind.
      G       D         Em           D   
So we offer a chorus to those gone before us
    Em        D       C
and one in particular shines.

[Pre Chorus]
   G           D         Em             D  
So I'll say hello to the girls that you know
            G                C        Em         D
and they'll laugh 'till they cry over stories of you.
     G         D          Em              D   
At a table for one I'll recall all you've done
         Em        D            C
and I'll finish my Guinness for two.

[Chorus]
C         D
Away! Oh, away!
  G         C   D
A glass for one away.
  C          D
Today! Oh, today!
    G       C      D
The past is done today.

[Verse 2]
Well, they say when you lose any limb you could choose
that surely you feel it, but surely it's gone.
In the same way we know up above we'll be whole
and our grand misadventures go on.

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Though I miss you like burning, I don't wish your returning
for you have gone on to joy evermore.
And I'll follow you soon for a life is a tune
and together we'll sing the encore. 

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
