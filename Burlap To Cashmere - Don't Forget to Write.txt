It's a bit confusing to notate a song relative to a capo and then have parts, like the intro here, played with bar chords. The first bar chord is a Cm, but since we need to keep the notation of the capo it's Am (and the numbers are relative to the capo). The capo is used to make the quick pulls used throughout the song possible.
 
The intro chords are:
A     [x x 7 9 10 9]
Emaj7 [x79897]
G     [xx5787] or? Gmaj7 [xx5777]
Dmaj7 [x57675]
F     [xx3565] or? Fmaj7 [xx3555]
Cmaj7 [x.5453]
 
the rest:
D   [xx0232] or sometimes he plays D*
G   [320003][3x0003]
C/G [3x2013]
C   [x32010] [x32013]
D*  [554030] (open C slid up 2)
Em  [022000]
B7  [x21202]
 
G C/G  combo played at the ends of lines:
G played with pinky and 3rd finger muting 5th string so that the C-chord can be played
quickly without changing hand position. Then first two fingers make the C/G (C with G in
the base) pulling off on the up strum.
