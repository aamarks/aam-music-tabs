D                       C       G        D
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone  x2
      F         C          F       C (G)   D     
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

 Lay down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest  x2
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West
 The sun will shine in my back door some day  x2
March winds will blow all my troubles away
 I wish I was a headlight on a north-bound train  x2
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain




2. Old & In the Way (Grateful Dead) - Midnight Moonlight

A                         E     
Do ya ever feel lonesome, (when you're) down in San Antone
Bm  E  D  G G#
Beg, steal or borrow two nickels or a dime to call me on the phone
A     E    Bm  E  F#m E D
G  D   G  D   G  D A  x2
And I'll meet you at Alamo Mission, where we can say our prayers
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us as we kneel there
In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight, moonlight

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling for the things that might have been
And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen
In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight, moonlight

      E                     A                           Bm     A        E      
There were two sisters came walking down the stream.    OH the wind and rain.
    E                     A                                    Bm     C#m      D        E      
The one behind pushed the other one in.                 Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain.
Johnny gave the youngest a gay gold ring                OH the wind and rain
Didn't give the oldest one anything                     Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain
They pushed her into the river to drown                 Oh the wind and rain                                    
Watched her as she floated down                         Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
Further till she came to a miller's pond                OH the wind and rain                                    
Mama oh father there swims a swan                       Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
The miller pushed her out with a fishing pole           OH the wind and rain                                    
Pulled that fair maid out from the brook                Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
He left her on the bank to dry                          Crying oh the wind and rain                             
And a fiddling fool come passing by                     Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
Out of the woods came a fiddler fair                    OH the wind and rain                                    
Took 30 strands of her long yellow hair                 Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
And he made a fiddle bow of her long yellow hair        OH the wind and rain                                    
He made a fiddle bow of her long yellow hair            Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
He made fiddle pegs of her long finger bones            OH the wind and rain                                    
He made fiddle pegs of her long finger bones            Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
And he made a little fiddle of her breast bone          OH the wind and rain                                    
The sound could melt a heart of stone                   Crying oh the dreadful wind and rain                    
And the only tune that fiddle would play was            OH the wind and rain                                    
And the only tune that fiddle would play was            OH the dreadful wind and rain

9. The Last Farewell   https://youtu.be/hKdRpDpIR70

C G C G  There's a ship lies…  C C7 F  Tomorrow for…
Dm F Dm F G  Far away from your…
C G C G  C C7 F  And I shall be aboard… at this farewell
Dm G C Am Dm G7 Dm G7  For you are beautiful…
C G7 C G7  …

 There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
 And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell.   x2

 I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
 I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell
For you are beautiful…   x2

 Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
 And should I return home safe again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale
For you are beautiful…   x2

10. Wild Horses (Old & In the Way version)


Tuning: EADGBe
Key of G

[Verse 1]
Bm        G          Bm      G   
Childhood living, Is easy to do
    Am         C    D    G               D  C
The things you wanted, I bought them for you

[Verse 2]
               
Graceless lady
                  
You know who I am
                         
You know I can't let you
                       
Slide through my hands

[Chorus]
Am   C     D      
Wild horses
G        F       C    Bm      
Couldn't drag me away
Am         C     D 
Wild, wild horses
G        F       C     (G)
Couldn't drag me away

[Verse 3]
                     
I watched you suffer
                   
A dull aching pain
                   
Now you've decided
                    
To show me the same

[Verse 4]
                 
No sweeping exit
                  
Or offstage lines
                          
Could make me feel bitter
                    
Or treat you unkind

[Chorus]
            
Wild horses
                      
Couldn't drag me away
                  
Wild, wild horses
                      
Couldn't drag me away

[Verse 5]
                        
I know I've dreamed you
                
A sin and a lie
                  
I have my freedom
                           
But I don't have much time

[Verse 6]
                      
Faith has been broken
                    
Tears must be cried
                     
Let's do some living
             
After we die
