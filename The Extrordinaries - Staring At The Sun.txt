[Intro] C#m E A Ab F#m E F#m A   (uses verse 1 chords)

[Verse 1]
C#m
We were never well-acquainted 
E
And everyone you knew was a state behind you 
A                                 Ab                     
Left to wonder where you went and why 
           F#m          E
But did it come as a surprise 
         F#m                            A
That our voices carried further in your mind 
                           C#m
than you would ever recognize 

C#m                               
We were on a first name basis, 
E
you were never good with names or faces 
A                                     Ab
I hate to think we never crossed your mind 
          F#m          E
But is it any question why? 
       F#m            A
In the end I couldn't stand the thought of you 


[Chorus]
E                             A  
Laying in bed, staring at the Sun   x4


[Verse 2]
C#m
We followed you across the nation, 
E
just another page in the compilation 
A                            Ab                     
But I was never there to disagree 
          F#m       E            A                 Ab
But is it any mystery that you'd still be haunting me? 
         F#m                           E
And am I better now to know your history? 
           F#m                                
Or could I ever been the one to hold your hand 
A                             
And whisper to you while you were 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]  D C#m F#m E Ab C#m D D C#m C#m D D A A

[Chorus]

[Outro]  E  A  x4    E
