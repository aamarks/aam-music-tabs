Steel City Rovers - Guinness For Two (Old)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xRHBuQVm9k

Notes:
Celtic Tuning https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl9q6dFOpA4
but this is not played with Celtic tuning

This can be played using a capo on 9 with the G D Em Cadd9 thing with the high strings always the same, but McKenna gets low notes e-c#-b-a using no capo and E B4 C#m7 Asus2, with open high b- and e-strings.

It's a 6/8 time jig with most chords lasting 3 beats except the last in stanzas where 12 beats are used and in the chorus. A bass guitar mostly plays on the first beat of a chord and has pronounced line at the end. Hard to do that on the guitar while strumming fast.

No Capo, Standard tuning, Key of E

[Verse 1]
         E          B4           C#m7        A2
Here and now we are less than we were nearly yesterday.
E          C#m7       A2           B4   
Death is a mystery to those left behind.
      E       B4        C#m7         A2    (not B4)  
So we offer a chorus to those gone before us
    C#m7      B4      A2 A2  A2 B4   
and one in particular shines.

[Pre Chorus]
   E           B4        C#m7           A2
So I'll say hello to the girls that you know
            E                C#m7     A2         B4   
and they'll laugh 'till they cry over stories of you.
     E         B4         C#m7            A2 A2
At a table for one I'll recall all you've done
         C#m7'     B4'          A2 A2  B4 B4   
and I'll finish my Guinness for two.

[Chorus]
A2    A2   B4 B4
Away! Oh, away!
  E         B4   A2 A2
A glass for one away.
  A2   A2    B4 B4
Today! Oh, today!
    E       B4     A2 A2
The past is done today.

[Verse 2]
well, they Say when you Lose any Limb you could Choose
that Surely you Feel it, but Surely it's Gone.
in the Same way we Know up aBove we'll be Whole
and our Grand misadVentures go On.

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
though I Miss you like Burning, I don't Wish your reTurning
for You have gone On to Joy everMore.
and I'll Follow you Soon for a Life is a Tune
and toGether we'll Sing the enCore.
