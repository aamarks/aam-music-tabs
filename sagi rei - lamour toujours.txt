And I'll fly with you!

I'll fly with you!
I'll fly with you!

Here are the chords to this song.
The first guitar (more rithm-like) palys this:
Intro: G D F# Bm

G D          F#            Bm
  I still believe in your eyes;
G             D
I just don't care what
        F#           Bm
You've done in your life.

 G        D          F#           Bm
Baby i'll always be here by your side;
 G              D          F#
Don't leave me waiting too long,
            Bm
Please come by!

..
And somewhere in the song there is background of this:
e|-3-5-3-2--3-5-3-2---|
B|------------------3-|

You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!
You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!
You are, are, are, are, are, are!!!

The 2nd guitar (in my band it's used to harmonize) plays another
version of the chords, more melodic:

Intro : C Em Am F
follow this pattern in the 4/4 measure. It's easy. I play it in trance-style (heavy
along with the drums -snare, BD all than stuff Gigi uses for the rithm).
the rest of the song is just C Em Am F all over again.
In my band I'm doing the soloes so I must stop sometimes to pick
the following notes:

INTRO:
e:--8-10-12-7-8-10-8--13-12-13-15-13-12-10-12-15-12--13-12-10-8--------|
B:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
G:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
D:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
A:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
E:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
The intro is like Gigi's vocoded voice : ~~i still believe in your eyes (the female
high pitch stuff)

The solo (horn-like sound):
e|------7-6--6--6-7-4--4-4-2-4-2-4--|
B|-4--4----------------------------4|
G|----------------------------------|
D|----------------------------------|
A|----------------------------------|
E|----------------------------------|
Or in another scale:
e]----------------------------------[
B]------3-2--2--2-3-----------------[
G]------------------4--4-2-4-2-4-2--[
D]-4--4----------------------------4[
A]----------------------------------[
E]----------------------------------[

The synth part (bell-like sounds)
e--0h7-5p0-4p0-|-0h7-5p0-4---|
B--------------|-----------4-|
Various effects are needed here. Ask me and I'll tell you what you should do :).

Now, if you have a "friend" that plays bass (6 or 7 or 8! stringed one), the following
are for him (or you if you can play the bass)


BASS LINE ( trance version )

G-----------------------------------------------------------------|
D---------------------------------9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-|
A-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9---------------------------------|
E-----------------------------------------------------------------|

This part is played through out the whole song

INTERLUDE

E-12-17--15--14---12-17--15--14----------------------------|
B--------------------------------15------------------------|
G----------------------------------------------------------|
D----------------------------------------------------------|
A----------------------------------------------------------|
E----------------------------------------------------------|

This is played on top of the bass at certain times during the song

you'll be able to hear when it comes up.


Now, a guy tried to tab the base-line ( Bass-line for those who care).
I play it on my guitar, and on my bass with slap:
SLAP this
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Originally tabbed by: Matthias Delafontaine


I was playing the guitar when I heard the song out of the radio. I tried
to play with it and it sounded quite well, so I thougt "Why not tap it out?"
To be honest, it's not my kind of music, but I have to admit that the riff
is not bad.

This is all my own work.

A:5---9---9---5|

You can improvise on the riff...Hope you enjoy it.
Email me if you find any bugs.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

In conclusion, if you are a bassist, e-mail me (tomsofts@yahoo.com).
I need someone who can play bass better than me. Drummer needed too.
I already have a bassist (we are all GGDAG fans).

Help me in tabbing the following songs: La Passion, 1 2 3 Super,
Silence (bass and chords- already tabbed solo).
