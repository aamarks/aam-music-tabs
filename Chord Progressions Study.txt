Minor Key Chords

Notes from https://www.musical-u.com/learn/discovering-minor-chord-progressions-minor-chords-part-one/ 
There are many sound files there for examples of these chord progressions.




1. Natural Minor 

Key Am

Am Bdim   C   Dm Em F  G   Am
i  ii-dim III iv v  VI VII i

Melodic Minor

Am  Bm  C+   D  E  F#dim  G#dim   Am
i   ii  III+ IV V  vi-dim vii-dim i




2. Harmonic Minor

The transition from the v (Em) back to i (Am) is not very compelling so natural minor progressions are not that common. Instead the Harmonic Minor uses the 11th semitone. The half step from the root note (in the key of Am that's G#) allows for chords (E : E-G#-B) that beg to go back to the root. 

Key Am

Am  Bdim   C+   Dm E  F  G#dim   Am
i   ii-dim III+ iv V  VI vii-dim i

i–iv–v vs i–iv–V
The difference is readily apparent in these progressions.

Am Dm Em Am (natural)

Am Dm E Am (harmonic)


[I  ii-dim V i]
(there isn't a very good way to play dim chord on the guitar)

Am Bdim   E Am 
i  ii-dim V i

Em F#dim  B Em 
i  ii-dim V i
