Blue Moon -- The Extraordinaires

Chaplans Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEa8FLq5IWA)
Live Diner Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liMVIod9Tpk)
Some lyrics are slightly mixed around in the two versions.
This is the ukulele/diner version.

Asterisk on a chord indicates there is a quick series of note changes.
   G6     [0202] [7777]
   Gdim   [0101] (just briefly from G6)
   G6*    switching from [0202] to [0101] usually on the 4& beat
   E7     [1202]
   C      [0003] (something like or [0003] [0002] [0003] [2000])
   D6     [2222] (or maybe D [2220])
   Cm7    [3333] (D#6 alternate name, possibly [3335] tossed in at times)
   C6     [0000]

   chorus at end
   G      [0232]
   D#dim  [2320] (with some various pinky notes played on "floor": [2320] [2420] [2320] [2323]?)
   Em     [0432] (seems to mute top string with pinky, or hammer 5th fret, every beat)

(There are alternate names for those chord shapes. I'm no expert and can't say which are
proper for the key.)
Hard to tell sometimes when he's playing a note with the pinky or just using it to mute.

[Intro]
G6 Gdim x7
G6 Gdim G6

[Verse 1]
            G6
When you're up
    Gdim G6
You come down
    Gdim G6    Gdim G6      E7
Then you hide, in a cloud I wonder
     C      Cm7     G6*
What I, can do, for you

        G6
You get big
    Gdim G6
You get  small
     Gdim G6                         Gdim G6    E7              C
There are nights that I don't see you at all Oh what's your name
                  Cm7           G6*
Must be something, I can do for you

[Chorus]
     G6
Blue moon
                      Gdim
When you gonna come a-round
                        C6                 D6                 G6*
I'm here waiting on the ground and I'll be here when you come down

     G6
Blue moon
                          Gdim
How'd you make it on your own
                        C6
You don't need to be a-lone
            D6                 G6*
Just let me know when you come down

[Verse 2]
            G6
When you're up
    Gdim G6
You come down
    Gdim G6        Gdim G6      E7
Then you hide, from the crowd I wonder
     C      Cm7     G6*
What I, can do, for you

        G6
You get big
   Gdim G6
You get small
     Gdim G6                     Gdim G6       E7               C
There are nights I want to give you a call  Oh what's your name
                  Cm7            G6*      C6 D6 G6
Must be something, I can do for you

[Verse 3]
         G6
You come near
  Gdim G6
You go far
   Gdim G6        Gdim G6       E7           C
I'll be here, when you call  Oh what a shame,
                   Cm7          G6*
Must be something, I can do for you

[Chorus]
     G6
Blue moon
                      Gdim
When you gonna come a-round
                        C6                 D6                 G6
I'm here waiting on the ground and I'll be here when you come down
C6    D6
I wanna hold you

     G6
Blue moon
                          Gdim
How'd you make it on your own
                        C6
You don't need to be a-lone
            D6                 G6*
Just let me know when you come down

[Chorus]
(varies from previous)
     G
Blue moon
                    D#dim
I can't take it any more
                      Em
Are you hollow at the core
                         D#dim*
Let your worries hit the floor

     G
Blue moon
                     D#dim
Take it easy take it slow
                         Em
We don't have nowhere to go
                        C6            D6    G6
You just have to let me know when you come around

[Outro]
G       D#dim       Em            D#dim
Da d-da da  d-da-d- da da da da d da da...
G       D#dim       Em       C6   D6
Da...   da...       da...
