[Verse]
  E                 Ab    Dbm             A
I sit and watch the world alone from this star
E           Ab          Dbm            A
I see you approaching I wonder who you are
E               Ab    Dbm      A        E       B-Bs4-B-Bs4
What's a little angel doing so far from heaven

E                 Ab      Dbm                A
What is it you're seaking What would be your prize
E             Ab           Dbm               A
Is it no fair peeking if I look past your disguise
E               Ab   Dbm         A         E       B-Bs4-B-Bs4
Would I see an angel that I recognize from heaven

[Chorus]
Dbm              A
 You taveled far You traveled long
Dbm                 A
 Listening for that brand new song
Dbm           A                E       B-Bs4-B
 We can sing along to show him praises

[Verse]
E                    Ab          Dbm         A
Are you one of those angels who attempted to rebel
E                  Ab           Dbm               A
You waged a war in heaven, were defeated, and you fell
E                    Ab         Dbm                 A         E       B-Bs4-B-Bs4
Are you one of those angels who went all the way to hell from heaven

whistles [verse chords]

[Chorus]
Dbm              A
 You taveled far You traveled long
Dbm                 A
 Listening for that brand new song
Dbm             A              E       B-Bs4-B-Dm7
 We can sing along to show him praises

Dbm                   A
 But all the choruses you learn
Dbm                  A
 Will not be sung at your return
Dbm                   A                  E    B-Bs4-B
 Back to that lake of fire that burns in blazes

[Verse]
E                    Ab          Dbm         A
Are you one of those angels who attempted to rebel
E                   Ab          Dbm               A
You waged a war in heaven, were defeated, and you fell
E                    Ab         Dbm                 A         E      B-Bsus4
Are you one of those angels who went all the way to hell from heaven

E               Ab    Dbm      A        E      
What's a little angel doing so far from heaven
