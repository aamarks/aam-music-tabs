[Intro]
Am Am

[Verse 1]
Am                           E       
Strange things are happening everyday
           A                 Dm  
I hear the music up above my head
F                               Am           
Though the side of my heart has left me again
       E         Am  
I hear music up above

[Verse 2]
Am                         E  
Secrets are written in the sky
           A                 Dm               
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found
F                            Am           
Though the sound of hope has left me again
       E         A Am
I hear music up above

[Bridge]
A                               AM7       
Standing in my broken heart all night long
Fm                                  D            
Darkness held me like a friend when love wore off
A                                     AM7      
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross
            Fm    D
The finders love
Bm E      A                 Fm
I know I loved you too much
        Bm  E      A        Dm E
Ill go alone to get through

[Instrumental]

A  Dm

E  Am

[Verse 4]
Am                     E           
I hear Rosetta singing in the night
         A                                     Dm  
Echos of lighting shine like stars after their gone
      F                         Am         
And tonight she's my guide as I go on alone
         E         Am   E  Am  E  Am
