He uses a capo, looks like on 4th fret so he must tune down a half step
Each measure of C in the verses is as tabbed out in the intro
so it's really C Am7/G Gadd4, or C C6 Cmaj9.

I hold a full C/G [332010] and move fingers as necessary.
On the partial G play the low strings on the first down strum
then the high strings on the following lighter strums.
You can hear the low a-note and g-note on beats 4 & 7.

I usually hold my thumb on the E-string for an F-chord,
but really you're strumming just the 1st 4 high strings for this.
 
You can hammer on a bit for the C's, F's, Am's in the chorus (2nd string for the Am)...

[Verse 1]
C
Baby's got herself a new black dress 
C
Put her pretty face on and then all the rest
F
She was beautiful 
C
Well, I walked in and I looked like a mess 
C
(I) saw frown on her face and hives on her chest 
F
It was beautiful 

[Chorus]
              C                       G
 Baby's got a new dress, baby's got a new car
          Am                            F
 With the summer sun steady running out luck 
 C                            G
 (But) out in the ocean in slow motion 
 F                      G                C
 There's a message in a bottle just for us 

[Verse 2]
C
3 years later we were talking real tall 
C
Bought a bunch of new clothes, a couple new cars 
F
To get us by 
C
With piles of bills and our heads on the wall 
C
Summer left so fast and then came fall, 
F
We made it by 

[Chorus]
              C                       G
 Baby's got a new dress, baby's got a new car
          Am                            F
 With the summer sun steady running out luck 
 C                            G
 (But) out in the ocean in slow motion 
 F                      G                C
 There's a message in a bottle just for us 

[Verse 3]
C
Here in the city life seems so small 
C
We make believe that we matter at all 
F
in this life 
C
She loves with her smile. She loves with her soul 
C
Such a pretty little thing just helping me hold 
F
on tight 

[Chorus]
              C                       G
 Baby's got a new dress, baby's got a new car
          Am                            F
 With the summer sun steady running out luck 
 C                            G
 (But) out in the ocean in slow motion 
 F                      G                C
 There's a message in a bottle just for us
