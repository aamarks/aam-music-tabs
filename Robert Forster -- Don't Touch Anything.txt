G Bm C   G Bm C  

G           Bm                C
 Now that I know how to control myself
G               Bm                   C
 Now that I’ve learnt how to contain myself
G          Bm    C
   “Life is art.” 
G          Bm    C
   “Art is life.”
G      Bm     B            F#  
 But have you met my wife? Have you met my wife?

G             Bm       C
    Don’t get involved
G                  Bm       C
    Just let it burn or ring
G                 Bm    B
    Wait until it gets fixed
          E       
And don’t touch anything 
          B
And don’t touch anything  
          C
And don’t touch anything


G          Bm                  C
Now that I know who the devil is
G          Bm                     C
And I can live without seeing the pyramids
G          Bm    C
 “Love your work.”
G          Bm    C
 “Work your love.” 
G              Bm         B         F#  
 But I seem to have lost a glove? And it was a winter glove

G             Bm       C
    Don’t get involved
G                  Bm       C
    Just let it burn or ring
G                 Bm    B
    Wait until the man comes
          E       
And don’t touch anything 
          B
And don’t touch anything  
          C
And don’t touch anything
          B                         C D E
And don’t touch         anything


G           Bm           C
Now that I know what it is that I do
G           Bm            C
I never had a doubt about me and you
G         Bm                C
Every evening is a patch of blue
G             Bm             C
I never had a doubt    about me and you

G Bm C

And don’t touch anything 
          B
And don’t touch anything  
          E       
And don’t touch anything 
          B
And don’t touch anything  
          C
And don’t touch anything
          B
And don’t touch         anything
