Mandolin Orange – Gospel Shoes


Some set their heads to swimming, nothing to lose 
Drift about their good times, slivers in their boots 
Some walk the straight and narrow, only passing through 
Trading this world over for a pair of gospel shoes 

Gospel shoes are laced with shackles and chains 
Fitted for the poor runners of the race 
Now every hand is folded shape of a gun 
Target's ever changing but the war it rages on 

So the armies march onward for the mother and the son 
As this world of screaming color is bleached in the blood 

Freedom was a simple word so reverent and true 
A long time ago, it meant the right to choose 
Who you love and how to live, now it's so misused 
Twisted by the politics of men in gospel shoes 

So the armies march onward for the mother and the son 
As this world of screaming color is bleached in the blood 
Our mother she is crying, her broken heart is blue 
'Cause we're too busy dying to love this life we lose 

She's growing weary of the lying 
She's tired of all this fighting in the name of gospel shoes﻿
