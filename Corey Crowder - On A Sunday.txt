C                 F               C 
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                        (G/C) G 
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C 
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                    G            F   
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
G[355433] F G C  x2
G[355433] F G


    F                  G
The neighbors hear our conversations 
    F                   G                 Am
But they can't hear the love we're making now 
  F                  G
I kissed your cheek as you were waking 
  F               G                 Am     G
I told you that I loved you and you smiled 


C                 F               C 
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                        (G/C) G 
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C 
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                    G            F   
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
G[355433] F G C  x2
G[355433] F G


    F                  G
Forget about the smoke we're clearing 
    F                G                 Am
Just think of me and know that you are needed 
  F                  G
Slowly move, it's me I'm cheating 
  F               G                 Am     G
An open mind is what I'm seeking now 


C                 F               C 
If our lives were built here on a Sunday
C                        (G/C) G 
Then maybe we can wave to the sky 
     C               F                  C 
Cus' many lives were built here but are crumbling 
C                        G        F 
Well, Honey I'm just thankful I'm alive 
C              G              F   
Maybe we'll be thankful we're alive
