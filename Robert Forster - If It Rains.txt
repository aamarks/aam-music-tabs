Robert Forster - If It Rains 
____________________________
Album: The Evangelist (2008)

 Simple. I've put a slash before a chord to indicate it is strummed only once and is on the last beat of the previous chord's time.


[Intro] (the chords of the first verse)


F  /B C      F   /C    B
If it rains, now we’ll change
      F    /B  C    F     /C    B
We’ll hold and save all of what came
          F     /C   B
We won’t let it run away
C      F    B             F  B
If It Rains  (wo wo wo wo)


F  /B C      F         /C    B
If it rains, different this time
         F     /B  C        F        /C  B
We won’t break the chain or make our own rain
           F    /C   B
We’ll just take what came
C     F  B  F  B  C  C  F /C B  F /C B  C  C 
If It Rains

If it rains, we’ll worship again
      F    /B   C    F       /C  B
We’ve seen what came without the rain
         F             /C B
We‘ll be thankful that it came
C     F  B  F  B  C  C  F /C B  F /C B  C  C  C  C  F
