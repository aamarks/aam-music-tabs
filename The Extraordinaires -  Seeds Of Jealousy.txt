[verse 1]
C                            Am
Every time you leave me here on this old deck of mine
C                               Am
I can't help but wonder why you have to spend your time
F                               C
Waltzing with the wind so high, you're wrapped up in its arms so tight
   Em                                  F               C    
It scares me half to death because I'm not the jealous type


[instrumental]         
   Am C Am F C Em F


[verse 2]
    C                                  Am
You tell me all the time that I'm your one and only love
     C                               Am
Then every time I turn around you're laughing up above
F                             C
Why am I not good enough? The competition's killing us
    Em                               F                 C    
You seem like you're on the run, and I just can't keep up


[instrumental]         
   Am C Am F C Em F


[chorus]
    Em                  C
Annelies, where are you goin'?
  G                             B
I think I may just tag along so I can see what's going on
    Em                 C
Annelies, what are you hiding?
   G                                     B
We tell each other everything 'cause you promised with that wedding ring, 
    Em C G B7 Em C G B7 B7
Annelies

[outro]
C        E         Am      F           
Signs of guilt and longing lust 
    C           E         Am      F           
you mouth those words but I don't trust you
C        E        Am    F           
Take the throttle or my hand 
   C       E        Am     F           
If I can't have you no one can
C        E         Am       F           
Lock the doors and seal the hatches, 
C        E         Am        F           
break my heart and burn this mattress
C        E        Am    F           
Take the throttle or my hand 
   C       E        Am     F           
If I can't have you no one can

      C     E        Am    F   x7        
Wo-o  Oh oh oh-oh-oh oh
      C     E        Am    F    C      
Wo-o  Oh oh oh-oh-oh oh    wah  ooo
